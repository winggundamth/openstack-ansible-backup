Run these commands on deploy node

```bash
# Install this role
ansible-galaxy install -f opsta.openstack-ansible-backup
# Create playbook file
wget -O /opt/openstack-ansible/playbooks/openstack-backup.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opsta/openstack-ansible-backup/master/playbooks/openstack-backup.yml
